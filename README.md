# Template-Engine

![Demo](Readme.gif)

What we ultaimtely built was a software engineering team generator command line application. This application will conclusevely prompt the user for information about the employee, manager, intern and engineer. This in terms will make the user input any number of team members, as well as mixing the amount of engineers and intern the user would like to implement. This assignment was able to assign unit testing and was also able to pass it as well. Once the user has completed in building the set team, the application can then be run in generating an HTML file that will display a formatted team. This is based on the information that was provided from the user in which they place their desired inputs.
